# Hollow King

## Game Description
Hollow King is a Hollow Knight and Jump King inspired game where you explore a unique world in a 2D medieval setting.
Traverse through uniquely designed levels and immerse yourself in this homebaked world as you face increasingly
dangerous threats and parkour your way through.

This project was developed by Guilherme Figueiredo (up202406001@up.pt) and Renato Ribeiro (up202406079@up.pt) for LDTS
2025-26.

## Implemented Features
- **Feature 01** - feature description.
- **Feature 02** - feature description.

## Planned Features
- **Realistic 2D Movement** - Our aim is to make the player behave in a somewhat realistic way within the 2D environment
    of the game. Being affected by things like gravity and of course collisions.
- **Open Levels** - The game will take place in so-called levels which are vast rooms for the player to explore and 
  potentially interact with. Each level is unique and the camera follows the player along the map to give a sense of 
  vastness to the world.
